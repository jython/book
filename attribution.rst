Acknowledgment and Dedications
==============================

Josh Juneau

First and foremost, I would like to thank my wife Angela for standing beside me
throughout my career and writing this book. She has been my inspiration and
motivation for continuing to improve my knowledge and move my career forward.
She is my rock, and I dedicate this book to her. I also thank my wonderful
children: Katie, Jake, Matt, and our new addition Zachary, for always making me
smile and for understanding on those weekend mornings when I was writing this
book instead of playing games. I hope that one day they can read this book and
understand why I spent so much time in front of my computer.

I’d like to thank my parents and grandparents for allowing me to follow my
ambitions throughout my childhood. My family, including my in-laws, have always
supported me throughout my career and authoring this book and I really
appreciate it. I look forward to discussing this book with my family at future
gatherings as I’m sure they will all read it soon.

My co-workers, especially Roger Slisz, Necota Smith, and Matt Arena, who showed
me the ropes in IT. Without that knowledge I wouldn’t have ventured into
learning about Oracle and PL/SQL, which ultimately led to this! I’d like to
especially thank Roger Slisz and Kent Collins for trusting me to guide and
develop the applications for our department, and for allowing me the freedom to
manage my projects and provide the necessary time and resource toward our
applications and databases.

I’d really like to thank Jim Baker for providing me with the opportunity to
become the lead author for this book. I appreciate that he believed in me to
provide the leadership and knowledge to make this book a reality. Jim Baker is
a great person and a scholar; without him, this book may not have been written.
Jim and I collaborated to find the other great authors that helped us write
this book. In the end, I believe that the team of authors that was chosen
provides the perfect blend of knowledge and skills that went into authoring
this book. I thank each of the authors for devoting their time and effort
towards this book; I think that it will be a great asset to the community!
Thanks for everything, I look forward to writing the second edition soon!

I owe a huge thanks to Duncan Parkes of Apress for providing excellent support
and advice. I also wish to thank all of our technical reviewers and our Apress
project coordinator, Mary Tobin. All of their efforts helped to make this book
complete and we couldn’t have done it without you. Last, but definitely not
least, I’d like to thank the Jython developers and the community as a whole.
The developers work hard to provide us with this great technology allowing us
to write Python on the JVM. Frank Wierzbicki has done an excellent job in
leading the core of Jython developers to produce 2.5.1, and I know that he’ll
continue to do a great job leading into the future. Thanks to the community for
using Jython and providing great ideas and support via the mailing lists;
without this help I could not provide the newsletter and podcast.

This book is dedicated to my kids, Zack and Zoe, who are just about the best
children a dad could hope for: happy, loving, and fun to be with. Fundamentally
what I love to do is create, so it's wonderful watching you grow!

Three years ago we had this audacious idea in reviving Jython. We would jump to
supporting the 2.5 version of the Python language. And we would focus on make
it a suitable platform for running the increasingly large apps that are being
developed. This meant a renewed focus on compatibility for Jython. Fortunately
we could leverage the new reality that developers of Python applications,
frameworks, and libraries increasingly have a committment to strong testing.
Our problem was tractable because we could use this testing to converge on a
robust implementation.

This book documents that we in fact achieved this goal, while still preserving
the ability for you to interactively explore and script the Java platform. In
other words, Jython has grown up, but it hasn't forgotten what made it both
useful and fun in the first place.

To my good friend Frank Wierzbicki, we made it happen; Charlie Nutter, for his
committment to collaboration; Bruce Eckel and Albert Wenger, who both convinced
me that working on Jython was important; Leslie Hawthorn of the Google Open
Source Programs Office; Dorene Beaver; John Rose, Brian Goetz, and Ted Leung at
Sun, for their support of alternative languages on the JVM; Glyph Lefkowitz,
Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Chris Perkins, and Mark Ramm, for their support of a robust
Python ecosystem; my fellow Jython developers, Alan Kennedy, Charlie Groves,
Josh Juneau, Nicholas Riley, Oti Humbel, and Phil Jenvey, not to mention many
other contributors. And especially to my Google Summer of Code students, now
also Jython committers, Leo Soto and Tobias Ivarsson: it's been wonderful
watching you grow as both developers and individuals.

Thanks to Liz and Rosie for putting up with far too many side projects this
year. Special thanks to everyone in the Jython and Python developer community
for making life as a programmer much less painful than it could be.

Leo Soto
--------

First, thanks to my family for having the patience with me for having taking yet
another challenge which decreases the amount of time I can spend with them.
Specially Eliana, my mother, who has taken a big part of that sacrifice, and
also Nicolás, my brother, who gives encouragement in his particular way. They
and Leocadio, my father, who rests in peace, forged my personality and share
credit on every goal I achieve.

Thanks to all my friends for sharing my happiness when starting this project and
following with encouragement when it seemed too difficult to be completed. I
would have probably give up without their support and example on what to do
when you really want something.

Speaking of encouragement, I must mention that Jim Baker is responsible for
having me on the team who wrote this book: first by mentoring me on Jython and
later by insisting that I should share part of what I have learned on this
book. He is a great person and I can only be grateful to have met him.

Thanks to Josh Juneau, our lead author. He coordinated our numerous team and
made sure we all were on the right track. He did that while also working on a
lot of chapters and also handling the paperwork. I have no idea how he managed
to do it. All I know is that he rocks.

Thanks to Duncan Parkes, our editor, and all the technical reviewers who worked
on this book. Not only by catching mistakes but also by suggesting those
additions that can seem obvious in hindsight but that would never occurred to
you.

On the first half of the Django chapter I received a lot of help from Jacob
Fenwick who discovered some problems on specific platforms and offered valuable
suggestions to overcome them. Thanks to him many readers won't experience the
frustration caused when the code shown on the book doesn't work on their
environment. By the way, while working on Django integration with Jython I've
met a lot of nice people on the Django community. Special thanks to Jacob
Kaplan-Moss for his outstanding support when I was working on that area.

And thanks to the Jython community! Starting with our leader, Frank Wierzbicki,
who has played a crucial role to move Jython forward in the last years. The
core Jython developers are also really awesome people and I'm immensely happy
to work with them on the project. And every person of the Jython community I've
talked to has been nice and even when criticizing they know how to be
constructive. I'm grateful to work with this community and hope their members
will find this book useful!


Frank Wierzbicki
----------------

First and foremost, I want to thank my wife, Jill Fitzgibbons, for all of the
support she has given through all of these years of Jython work. Most of that
work occurred on weekends, nights, while on vacation, and other times
inconvenient to my family. My daughter, Lily, who is five at the time of
writing, has also needed to show patience when her dad was working on Jython
and on this book. I want to thank my parents, who brought a Commodore 64 into
the house when I was still impressionable enough to get sucked into a life of
programming. I also want to thank all of the contributors and users of Jython.
They make my work on Jython and this book worth doing.


Special Thanks
==============

Throughout the process of writing this book, many individuals from the community
have taken time out to help us out. We'd like to give a special thanks to the
Python and Jython community as a whole for actively participating in the
feedback and contributions for this book via the mailing lists.

We also thank the Python and Jython developers for producing this great
programming language.  So much hard work has gone into the Python language that
it has become one of the most solid and widely used object oriented programming
languages available today.  The Jython developers have done a tremendous job
bringing the Jython of today up-to-speed with current versions of the Python
language.  The Jython community seems to be working harder than ever before at
making it a viable option for programming modern Python and Java applications
alike.  Special thanks to those developers who have helped out with this book
and still kept Jython advancing.

The authors of The Definitive Guide to Jython would like to offer an extra
special thanks to the rest of the individuals in this section.  Without your
insight or contributions portions of this book may not have been possible.

**James Gardner** - Thanks to James Gardner for his help in providing us with a
working toolset and knowledge to convert from restructured text format to MS
Word for the Apress editing process.  The open source book was written
completely in restructured text, and converted to .doc format for the Apress
drafts and editing procedures. James offered great insight on how he used this
process with The Pylons Book, and he also provided us with a conversion utility
that was used for his book.
